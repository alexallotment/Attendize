                                            Our website contains a large number of Tickets and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Tickets listed on our website may be incorrectly priced. 
                                            We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Ticket 's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when 
                                            dispatching the Ticket to you. If a Tickets correct price is higher than the price stated on our website, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions 
                                            before dispatching the Ticket , or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.

                                            unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing.
